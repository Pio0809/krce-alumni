        <h3 class="tie">TO BECOME AN ALUMNI:</h3>
        <p class="gogo"> It is the college or university, however, that must take the lead in developing a culture of alumni engagement. Few alumni will seize the initiative or feel empowered to unilaterally start programs to benefit their institution and/or other former
            students. Alumni must feel valued by their alma mater, welcomed by it, and supported when they do step forward. If alumni are to become actively involved, the college or university must help direct their energies by communicating to them its
            needs, priorities and the areas where it can benefit from alumni assistance.An educational institution must also demonstrate its commitment to alumni engagement by means other than simply offering a better magazine, larger reunions, more e-mail,
            and an increased alumni giving goal. Alumni must be made to feel like insiders and be assured they are important members of the communityâ€”they must believe their opinions matter and that they have a meaningful stake in shaping and advancing
            their alma mater. If, for instance, alumni are not well represented on the governing board or they are not informed about critical events at the college, they can reasonably conclude they are outsiders and are not valued. Thus a culture of
            alumni engagement requires both thoughtful planning and constant vigilance to provide alumni with tangible and symbolic assurances that they do indeed matter and that they are central to the well-being and the future of their school. An engaged
            alumni population that feels it has a major stake in the future of its university will be much more responsive and enthusiastic when the institution asks for help. Thus a university that wishes to increase its alumni giving totals and their
            participation rate may discover that its fundraising efforts will be received more enthusiastically if hoped-for donors have already seen, heard and felt efforts by the university to communicate with, engage and support them in ways beyond
            gift solicitations. Eight Elements of Successful Alumni Engagement: I've participated in advancement programs at a variety of institutions, doing so as an employee, volunteer and consultant. I've been fortunate to observe alumni relations
            programs that are terrific models for how to effectively engage alumni in the life of an institution; I have also witnessed programs that were horribly misguided, treated alumni with condescension, or all but ignored them. From my thirty years
            of experiencing the good, bad and ugly of alumni relations, I have identified eight elements that always seem to be in place at institutions that enjoy a rewarding, mutually beneficial partnership with their graduates.</p>
