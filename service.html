        <P class="viru">Attending career counselling workshops at your university is the perfect way to explore your motivations and assets, the skills you could offer a business, and careers you would be a good match for. Career counselling is especially useful if you
            aren’t quite sure which direction to head in. It will help you discover new options and decide on a pathway. Your university careers center can also help you when applying for jobs, searching for internships or contacting alumni in your sector.Some
            universities offer a student medical service on campus with flexible appointments, telephone consultations, walk-ins and healthcare professionals dedicated to assisting students. Whether you’d like advice on contraception or are suffering
            from a bout of “Freshers’ flu”, your campus nurse or doctor should put you at ease so that you feel comfortable speaking freely about any medical issues bothering you. International students (both EU and other) at UvA are entitled to use the
            university doctors, as long as they have health insurance in place.Some universities offer study skills workshops and training courses to teach students effective revision strategies and time management. Some workshops are more personalized
            than others. UvA’s ‘study skills workshop for international master’s students’, for instance, is specifically designed to teach international postgraduate students perhaps unfamiliar with the Dutch educational system effective revision strategies
            and skills. </P>
