        <p class="dhonipara">Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu family with roots in Uttarakhand.[15][16] He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[17][18][19][20] His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil,
            Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.[21] His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[22]
            Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname as Dhauni.[21][needs copy edit] Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[23] but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav
            Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.[24] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995â€“1998). Based
            on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.[20] From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station
            under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[56] The team also saw
            the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[56] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad
            for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[57] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[58] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.
